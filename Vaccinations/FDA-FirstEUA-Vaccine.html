Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the first emergency
use authorization (EUA) for a vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older. The
emergency use authorization allows the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine
to be distributed in the U.S.

*“The FDA’s authorization for emergency use of the first COVID-19
vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic
that has affected so many families in the United States and around the
world,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Today’s action
follows an open and transparent review process that included input from
independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough
evaluation by the agency’s career scientists to ensure this vaccine met
FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and
manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization. The
tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious,
and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its
emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and
public-private collaboration worldwide.” *

The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the
statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available
data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may
be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also support that the
known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks,
supporting the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and
older, including healthy individuals. In making this determination, the
FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a
thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and
manufacturing quality information.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains messenger RNA (mRNA),
which is genetic material. The vaccine contains a small piece of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus’s mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the
virus’s distinctive “spike” protein. When a person receives this
vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not
cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react
defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.    

*“While not an FDA approval, today’s emergency use authorization of the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course
of this pandemic in the United States,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D.,
Director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.
“With science guiding our decision-making, the available safety and
effectiveness data support the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine because the vaccine’s known and potential benefits
clearly outweigh its known and potential risks. The data provided by the
sponsor have met the FDA’s expectations as conveyed in our June and
October guidance documents. Efforts to speed vaccine development have
not sacrificed scientific standards or the integrity of our vaccine
evaluation process. The FDA’s review process also included public and
independent review from members of the agency’s Vaccines and Related
Biological Products Advisory Committee. Today’s achievement is
ultimately a testament to the commitment of our career scientists and
physicians, who worked tirelessly to thoroughly evaluate the data and
information for this vaccine.”*

*FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data*

Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two
doses, three weeks apart. The available safety data to support the EUA
include 37,586 of the participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized,
placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S.
participants. These participants, 18,801 of whom received the vaccine
and 18,785 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median
of two months after receiving the second dose. The most commonly
reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at
the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint
pain, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects
after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for
vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some
side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose. 

It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report the
following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: all vaccine administration errors,
serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome
(MIS), and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death.

*FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data *

The effectiveness data to support the EUA include an analysis of 36,523
participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international
study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants, who did not have
evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through seven days after the second
dose. Among these participants, 18,198 received the vaccine and 18,325
received placebo. The vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19
disease among these clinical trial participants with eight COVID-19
cases in the vaccine group and 162 in the placebo group. Of these 170
COVID-19 cases, one in the vaccine group and three in the placebo group
were classified as severe. At this time, data are not available to make
a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor
is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2
from person to person. 

*The EUA Process*

On the basis of the determination by the Secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services on February 4, 2020, that there is a public
health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national
security or the health and security of United States citizens living
abroad, and then issued declarations that  circumstances exist
justifying the authorization of emergency use of unapproved products,
the FDA may issue an EUA to allow unapproved medical products or
unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency
to diagnose, treat, or prevent COVID-19 when there are no adequate,
approved, and available alternatives. 

The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of
a vaccine. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, the FDA
evaluates the available evidence and assesses any known or potential
risks and any known or potential benefits, and if the benefit-risk
assessment is favorable, the product is made available during the
emergency. Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request for a COVID-19
vaccine to the FDA, the agency then evaluates the request and determines
whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the
totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available
to the FDA.

The EUA also requires that fact sheets that provide important
information, including dosing instructions, and information about the
benefits and risks of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, be made
available to vaccination providers and vaccine recipients.

The company has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to FDA to monitor the
safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan
includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for
participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance
plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety
profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any
safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner.

The FDA also expects manufacturers whose COVID-19 vaccines are
authorized under an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain
additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue approval
(licensure).

The EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to Pfizer
Inc. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances
exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and
biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated, and
may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets
the statutory criteria for issuance.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety,
effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and
other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency
also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food
supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off
electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.
